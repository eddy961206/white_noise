This Chrome extension is specifically designed to provide users with a versatile noise generation tool that enhances focus and relaxation. By allowing users to select from various types of noise, such as white, pink, and brown noise, the extension aims to create a personalized audio environment that caters to individual preferences. The primary goal is to improve the user experience by offering customizable settings that can be adjusted according to the user's needs.

Regarding the permissions requested by the extension:

1. **Storage Permission**: This permission is essential for saving user settings and preferences locally on their device. By utilizing the Chrome storage API, we ensure that users can maintain their customized noise settings across different sessions. This means that when users return to the extension, their previous selections and adjustments will be preserved, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience. The storage permission is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and engagement with the extension.

2. **Offscreen Permission**: The offscreen permission is required to enable audio processing in the background. This allows the extension to play noise continuously without interrupting the user's interaction with the browser. By leveraging offscreen capabilities, users can enjoy their selected noise while navigating other tabs or applications, ensuring that their focus and relaxation are not disrupted. This permission is vital for delivering a smooth and uninterrupted audio experience, which is a core feature of the extension.

Overall, these permissions are requested to enhance the functionality and usability of the extension, ensuring that users have a reliable and enjoyable experience while using the noise generator.
